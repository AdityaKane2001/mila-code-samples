# Code samples for Mila application for Fall'23 

This repository contains some interesting code samples for my supervision 
request to Mila. I have made a separate repository for the samples since I believe 
there are quite a few samples which I would like to showcase. 

Following are quick descriptions of the code samples and links to them:

1. [TensorFlow code for Regnets and script to train them on ImageNet-1k](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001/mila-code-samples/blob/main/regnets).
2. [Concise code for implementing episodic memories](https://github.com/AdityaKane2001/mila-code-samples/blob/main/episodic_memories).
