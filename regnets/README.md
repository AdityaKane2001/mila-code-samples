# RegNets model and training script

This is the model definition and script for training [RegNets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.13678) on ImageNet-1k.

The trained models were merged to [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/applications/regnet), and later to [KerasCV](https://github.com/keras-team/keras-cv/pull/739).
